Quobie
Discuss your favorite book quotes (Genius for books).

1. A library/database of great literature quotes
2. Search quotes by content, book, author, or book genre
3. Add quotes to the database that haven't been added yet
4. Each quote has its own page, complete with discussions, claps, and sharing on social media
5. Add quotes to your personal collection/board

=== TO DO ===
* 'See More' link for long quotes that takes you to discussion
* Clap functionality
* Report functionality
* Build logic in 'AddComment' that attaches the current date (use Moment.js)
* Sort hierarchy of comments by number of claps by default, but also include option for sorting by newest
* Finish styling discussion page (meta/comments, and complete mobile responsiveness)
* Allow the selection of multiple genres and types (How will this be implemented on the UI?)
* Frontend logic for editing and deleting comment if userId is the same
* Frontend logic for editing a quote if userId is the same
* Load more (quotes, comments) on scroll
* Turn '/add-quote' into a modal, rather than a route
* Pin footer to the bottom of the page
* Terms of Service
* NAIL the backend schema
